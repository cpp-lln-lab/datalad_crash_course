## Goals

- install a datalad dataset and work with it
- create a datalad dataset and a remote copy of it online

The examples taken here on an MRI dataset but feel free to try this on dataset
with any other type of data.

## Prerequisites

In terms of technical knowledge, knowing some UNIX command line and some of the
Git basics might help but are not required.

But there are things you need to install and do before the workshop:

- [install datalad](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html)
  - for Windows, it is preferable to use the
    [Windows Subsystem Linux install](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html#ww-wsl2)
  - if you have a Mac M1, please check
    [this issue](https://github.com/datalad/datalad/issues/5701) for a
    workaround in case you run into problems
- [create a GIN account](https://gin.g-node.org/)
- [create an SSH key](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/generating-a-new-ssh-key-and-adding-it-to-the-ssh-agent)
- add it to your GIN account:
  - [see the github doc](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)
  - [see the datalad handbook](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-139-gin.html#prerequisites)
- [basic configuration](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/intro/installation.html#initial-configuration)

### Pre-flight checks

Checks to make sure everything is set up correctly

In a terminal, make sure that you have a version of datalad >= 0.13

```bash
datalad --version
```

**Example output**

```bash
datalad 0.13.4
```

Try to install a dataset from GIN

```bash
datalad install -s git@gin.g-node.org:/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw.git \
                  ~/CPP_visMotion-raw
```

The first time you do this, it will ask you some confirmation about using your
SSH key to connect to GIN. This is normal and you can safely say "yes".

**Example output**

```bash
install(ok): /home/remi/CPP_visMotion-raw (dataset)
```

If this install works, you can remove the dataset with.

```bash
rm -rf ~/CPP_visMotion-raw
```

## Install a BIDS dataset

Choose a BIDS dataset you want to install.

### From GIN

- a
  [public fMRI dataset from our lab](https://gin.g-node.org/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw)
- your own dataset from GIN: it should in a private repository you should have
  access to from the
  [CPP LLN lab organization on GIN](https://gin.g-node.org/cpp-lln-lab)

To install a dataset from GIN make sure you copy the SSH url:

![gin_ssh](./images/gin_ssh.png)

### From openneuro

- a dataset from [openneuro](https://openneuro.org/)
  - Each dataset has a "download" link that will give you the datalad command to
    install it.
  - See for example
    [this dataset](https://openneuro.org/datasets/ds004019/versions/1.0.0/download)

### Install it

This is done with the `datalad install` command.

In its simplest form it just requires a source URL to install a dataset from.

```bash
datalad install -s ${url}
```

<details><summary> <b>What's with the dollar <code>$</code> and the curly braces <code>{}</code>?</b> </summary><br>

This is how you can call previously stored variables in bash (the language used
by default in most terminals).

<pre>
url="git@gin.g-node.org:/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw.git"
datalad install -s ${url}
</pre>

</details>

<br>

So if the URL you copied is
`git@gin.g-node.org:/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw.git`, then you just need to
type:

**Example**

```bash
datalad install -s git@gin.g-node.org:/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw.git
```

You can also specify the folder where to install the dataset.

```bash
datalad install -s ${url} \
                  ${where_to_install}
```

**Example**

```bash
datalad install -s git@gin.g-node.org:/cpp-lln-lab/CPP_visMotion-raw.git \
                /home/remi/gin/CPP_visMotion-raw
```

If everything went smoothly the folder structure and the files should now be on
your computer and you can browse them in your file explorer or via your
terminal.

## Try to open a ‚Äútext‚Äù file

If we have a quick look at the content of our data, we can see that it contains
some plain text file like JSON or TSV.

**Example**

```bash
cd /home/remi/gin/CPP_visMotion-raw
tree -L 1
```

<details><summary> <b>What's this <code>tree</code> command?</b> </summary><br>

See this
<a href="http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-102-populate.html#f1">footnote</a>
in case you don't have it.

</details>

<br>

**Example output**

```bash
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ CHANGES
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ dataset_description.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ participants.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ participants.tsv
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con08
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con15
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ task-visMotion_bold.json
```

Try to open and edit one of these text files with your favorite text editor.

You can both open, modify and save that file.

## Try to open a datafile and failing

Let's try to open a file that is not "just" a text file.

In this example we could try to open a nifti image (`.nii`) with MRIcron,
fsleyes, SPM CheckReg...

If you have installed an EEG dataset you can try to load it with the tools you
usually use to quickly view those files.

**Example**

```bash
tree -L 3 sub-con07
```

**Example output**

```bash
sub-con07
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ses-01
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anat
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/j5/G3/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ func
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_task-visMotion_bold.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/mJ/PF/MD5E-s370137952--89a6190d568fa6cbb0fd1f23eb763b0c.nii/MD5E-s370137952--89a6190d568fa6cbb0fd1f23eb763b0c.nii
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_task-visMotion_events.tsv
```

Apparently fsleyes is not happy when trying to open the T1w file of an installed
dataset.

![fsl_not_happy](./images/fsl_not_happy.png)

### üö® Remote content üö®

This is because even though, the file shows up on your computer its "content"
has not been downloaded on your computer.

As one of our lab member once said:

> `datalad install` gives you bunch of "ghost file" üëª that have the right shape
> but no substance.

This is also why installing the whole dataset was so quick: very little data was
actually downloaded.

To fix this issue, we must get the content from where the dataset was installed.

## Getting data

To get the content of a file you use the `datalad get` command that must be run
from within the dataset (from a folder in the dataset).

```bash
datalad get ${path_to_the_folder_or_file}
```

**Example**

```bash
cd /home/remi/gin/CPP_visMotion-raw
datalad get sub-con07/anat/*T1w.nii
```

<details><summary> <b>What's with the star <code>*</code>?</b> </summary><br>

That's a bash thing to allow you to say "any sequence of characters". So in our
case that would mean any file in the <code>anat</code> folder that ends in
<code>T1w.nii</code>.

More on bash "globbing"
<a href="https://linuxhint.com/bash_globbing_tutorial/" target="_blank">here</a>

</details>

<br>

**Example output**

```bash
Total:   0%|                                                                             | 0.00/25.2M [00:00<?, ? Bytes/s]
Get sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii:  34%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà                        | 8.58M/25.2M [00:00<00:00, 64.9M Bytes/s]
```

And eventually:

```bash
get(ok): sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file) [from origin...]
```

**Note**

Depending on the color highlighting of your terminal, you might even see a
difference on the color of the file whose content you just got.

## Try to open a datafile and succeeding

You can now browse the actual content of that file.

![fsl_happy](./images/fsl_happy.png)

## Modifying data and failing

Let's now try to something basic on this image to modify it, like reorienting it
with SPM by setting the origin of the image to the anterior commissure.

In SPM, you can open the image with the `CheckReg` tool, locate the anterior
commissure and then right click `Reorient --> Set origin to cross-hair` and then
select the images to apply this change to.

SPM will try to modify the header of the image to implement the requested change
and will _fail majestically_ in the process.

![spm_not_happy](./images/spm_not_happy.png)

```matlab

------------------

```

The important error in there is `Error: Permission denied`.

However if we check the file permissions with our file explorer / finder (or
with the terminal), we can see that we have "write access" to these data. And
yet we can edit the simple "text" data and not the non "text" data.

**Example**

```bash
ls -l sub-con07/ses-01/anat
```

**Example output**

```bash
-rwxrwxr-x 1 remi remi 2170 Feb 14 14:23 sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.json
lrwxrwxrwx 1 remi remi  139 Feb 14 14:23 sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/j5/G3/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii
```

The `rwxrwxrwx` at the beginning of these lines defines if we have read (`r`),
write (`w`), execute (`x`) rights on those files. More on unix file permission
[here](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/unix/unix-file-permission.htm).

### üö® Under the hood: annexed files üö®

We cannot edit this file, because its content has been "annexed".

You can usually tell a file is annexed when listing it in a terminal with
`ls -l` or when viewing it with `tree`

```bash
lrwxrwxrwx 1 remi remi  139 Feb 14 14:23 sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/j5/G3/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii/MD5E-s25166176--d5dec5aad67f659c2f218f096cb4b8d4.nii
```

- the `l` means that the file you are looking at is a "link"
- the `->` at the end shows what this links to: in this case a file in the
  `.git/annex` in the root of the dataset
- the file size (the 5th column on the `ls` output above) is usually a hit that
  the content of that file has been annexed: in this case the "size" of this
  nifti image is less than that a very simple JSON file (which sounds unlikely
  if the content were not annexed).

A hand wavy explanation of this annexation behavior is that Datalad in fact acts
a bit as as "a wrapper" around:

1. git that is good for version controlling text based files (like code, TSV,
   JSON, ...) but start struggling with non-text files and large number of files
2. git-annex that helps for the version control of data files.

To be able to edit this file, we must first unlock it.

## Unlocking data

This is done with the `datalad unlock` command.

```bash
datalad unlock ${path_to_the_folder_or_file}
```

So in our case:

**Example**

```bash
datalad unlock sub-con07/ses-01/anat/*T1w.nii
```

**Example output**

```bash
unlock(ok): sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file)
```

The result of unlocking the file will be visible in different ways.

On a `tree` or a `ls` command, it won't show as a link but as an "actual" file.

**Example**

```bash
tree -L 3 sub-con07
```

**Example output**

```bash
sub-con07
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ ses-01
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ anat
    ‚îÇ   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.json
    ‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ func
        ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_task-visMotion_bold.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/mJ/PF/MD5E-s370137952--89a6190d568fa6cbb0fd1f23eb763b0c.nii/MD5E-s370137952--89a6190d568fa6cbb0fd1f23eb763b0c.nii
        ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_task-visMotion_events.tsv
```

Also an `ls -l` would now show you the actual actual size of this file.

If you use the `datalad status` command, datalad will tell that this file has
been modified because it was taken out of the annex.

**Example output**

```bash
 modified: sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file)
```

## Modifying data and succeeding

Now let's try to modify this file again.

This time SPM seems happy.

```matlab
------------------------------------------------------------------------
14-Feb-2022 21:17:17 - Running job #1
------------------------------------------------------------------------
14-Feb-2022 21:17:17 - Running 'Reorient Images'
14-Feb-2022 21:17:18 - Done    'Reorient Images'
14-Feb-2022 21:17:18 - Done
```

Now let's see what datalad says about the status of our dataset.

```bash
datalad status
```

**Example output**

```matlab
untracked: sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w_reorient.mat (file)
 modified: sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file)
```

Now datalad tells us about the files that have been modified and also about the
new file created by SPM.

## Saving data

When you want to save the changes you made to a dataset, simply use the
`datalad save` command.

You should also add a specific message to your save, to describe the content of
the save.

Here are some
[tips on how to write good save messages](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/basics/101-102-populate.html#fom-commit-message-guidance).

Note that a save are often reffered to as "commits" and that are thus
accompanied by a "commit message".

**Example**

```bash
datalad save -m 'setting origin to anterior commissure for subject 07'
```

**Example output**

```bash
add(ok): sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w_reorient.mat (file)
add(ok): sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file)
save(ok): . (dataset)
action summary:
  add (ok: 2)
  save (ok: 1)
```

Note that saving a file, relocks it in the annex.

```bash
tree -L 3 sub-con07/anat
```

**Example output**

```bash
sub-con07/ses-01/anat
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.json
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/VK/WP/MD5E-s25166176--f4db32e160f289d5cc01d3a23aadf4d0.nii/MD5E-s25166176--f4db32e160f289d5cc01d3a23aadf4d0.nii
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ sub-con07_ses-01_T1w_reorient.mat -> ../../../.git/annex/objects/68/79/MD5E-s312--85774df306f765822b4c203bca41bb13.mat/MD5E-s312--85774df306f765822b4c203bca41bb13.mat
```

See also how the new `.mat` file was annexed as well.

## The history of the dataset

You can check all the past changes that have been made to the dataset with the
`git log` command. Type `q` to exit this "log mode".

If you want a less verbose version of the log: `git log --online`.

```bash
097059d (HEAD -> master) setting origin to anterior commissure for subject 07
b003e21 (origin/master, origin/HEAD) initial save
2a72d36 Instruct annex to add text files to Git
52c0844 [DATALAD] new dataset
```

Given that more advanced usage of datalad allow you to "travel in time" through
the history of a dataset to see what it looked like at a given commit, you can
quickly imagine that having good commit message help you knowing what is your
"best destination".

## Pushing data and failing

Now that we have made a change we want to back it up online to make sure it is
not lost in case our computer catches on fire.

```bash
datalad push --to ${sibling_name}
```

When you install a dataset from somewhere, the dataset that lives on your
computer is usually called the local copy (when you talk to another human being)
or the local clone (when you talk to a git user) or a local
[sibling](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=sibling#term-sibling)
(when you talk to a datalad user). The sibling you installed from is usually
called a remote sibling and often nicknamed `origin`.

So to update the `origin` with our changes we would do:

**Example**

```bash
datalad push --to origin
```

Odds are that, unless you are the owner of the `origin` sibling, you encountered
an error that prevented from updating the online dataset.

### üö® Under the hood: siblings üö®

Very often you won't have the write access to make changes to the repository
where you got a dataset from.

If however you wanted to keep track of your own changes, you can have your own
copy of that dataset on GIN by creating a
[sibling](http://handbook.datalad.org/en/latest/glossary.html?highlight=sibling#term-sibling)
repository on GIN.

The good news is that **unless the data owner has given you the right to do
so**, it is extremely unlikely you will break or destroy someone else's data.

## Creating a remote repo

So let's create a repository on GIN.

![](images/gin_new.png)

To make your life easier do not initialize any file in this repository.

![](images/gin_new_2.png)

You must then copy the SSH URL.

![](images/gin_new_3.png)

You then need to let your local sibling that there is another repository. This
is done with the `datalad siblings add` command.

```bash
datalad siblings add --name ${name} --url ${url}
```

**Example**

```bash
datalad siblings add --name a_new_beginning --url git@gin.g-node.org:/RemiGau/a_new_beginning.git
```

**Example output**

```bash
[INFO   ] Could not enable annex remote a_new_beginning. This is expected if a_new_beginning is a pure Git remote, or happens if it is not accessible.
[WARNING] Could not detect whether a_new_beginning carries an annex. If a_new_beginning is a pure Git remote, this is expected.
.: a_new_beginning(-) [git@gin.g-node.org:/RemiGau/a_new_beginning.git (git)]
```

## Pushing data and succeeding

You should now be able to push your changes to this new sibling.

```bash
datalad push --to a_new_beginning
```

**Example output**

```bash
Transfer data to 'a_new_beginning':  50%|‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñå                      | 2.00/4.00 [00:00<00:00, 8.36k Steps/s]
Total:   0%|                                                                                 | 0.00/1.17G [00:00<?, ? Bytes/s]

```

And eventually:

```bash

Note however that your remote siblings contains the content for the data you had
in your local sibling.

You can use the `git annex list` to know where you have copy of what

**Example**

```bash
git annex list .
```

**Example output**

```
here
|a_new_beginning
||origin
|||web
||||bittorrent
|||||
XXX__ sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii
XX___ sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w_reorient.mat
__X__ sub-con07/ses-01/func/sub-con07_ses-01_task-visMotion_bold.nii
__X__ sub-con08/ses-01/anat/sub-con08_ses-01_T1w.nii
__X__ sub-con08/ses-01/func/sub-con08_ses-01_task-visMotion_bold.nii
__X__ sub-con15/ses-01/anat/sub-con15_ses-01_T1w.nii
__X__ sub-con15/ses-01/func/sub-con15_ses-01_task-visMotion_bold.nii
```

So if you wanted to make an entire copy of the original dataset you would to
`get` that content first from the `origin` and then `push` it to the new one.

```bash
datalad get .
datalad push --to a_new_beginning
```

We are not going to do that now otherwise we are going to be at this until the
cows come home.

## Dropping data

Sometimes our dataset get big and we usually start transferring them (or part of
them) on external hard drives and then we start having to keep track of which
file is backed up where, when was the back up done.

Then we get told we need several back ups in different locations, so now we have
to track several copies of the same dataset and make sure that they are all in
synch with each other.

Datalad allows you to keep a local copy of your data and to keep your different
back up (as siblings). But if you need to make some space on your computer
without having to delete a dataset, you can drop the content of files.

Conceptually this is the a bit like the opposite of the `datalad get` command we
saw earlier that would get the content of file from a sibling.

`datalad drop` will get rid of a content provided that this content exists in
another sibling.

To know how much data exists in your annex currently you can use
`datalad status --annex all`.

**Example output**

```bash
7 annex'd files (24.0 MB/1.1 GB present/total size)
nothing to save, working tree clean
```

You can then drop the content of specific files.

```bash
datalad drop ${path_to_file}
```

The nuclear option is to drop the entire dataset

**Example output**

```bash
datalad drop .
```

**Example**

```bash
drop(ok): /home/remi/gin/CPP_visMotion-raw/sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w.nii (file) [locking a_new_beginning...]
drop(ok): /home/remi/gin/CPP_visMotion-raw/sub-con07/ses-01/anat/sub-con07_ses-01_T1w_reorient.mat (file) [locking a_new_beginning...]
action summary:
  drop (notneeded: 20, ok: 2)
```

## Creating a dataset from scratch

<!-- TODO -->

```bash
datalad create ${name_of_the_dataset}
```

```bash
datalad create . --force
```

### Backing it up online

The following steps are things that we have seen in the previous steps.

1. `datalad save -m 'save all my data'`
1. Create an online repository on GIN
1. `datalad siblings add --name origin --url ${url}`
1. `datalad push --to origin`

Grab a coffee

## Useful tips

If you don't remember the specifics of a command, type the name of that command
followed by `--help`. For example `datalad create --help`.
